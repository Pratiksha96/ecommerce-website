## Backend API Development

- REST apis for search and filter products with pagination, user register, login and logout using Go lang.
- Search and filteration is done on the basis of product names, categories, price minimum and max value, page numbers
- All of the development was done VS code.
- The server was hosted using mux router and the APIs were configured on this.
- APIs were also configured with MongoDB database using product and user collections, and were tested using POSTMAN tool.
