## API Development

- REST apis for create, get, update and delete product were made using Go lang. 
- All of the development was done VS code.
- The server was hosted using mux router and the APIs were configured on this.
- APIs were also configured with MongoDB database, and were tested using POSTMAN tool.

## Test results

# Frontend 
## FrontEnd Technologies: React JS, CSS

## Homepage
A layout is created where a header and footer is displayed for all the pages. All the pages are mobile responsive. An hamburger is also created to visit different pages.
Here are the screenshots for the HomePage for different screen sizes.

## Products Page
Products Page is displaying the products with their title, rating, image and price. User gets route to different page on clicking a product. The Product Page is also mobile responsive.

## Connectivity with Backend
- After bringing front end and back end servers up and running, we connected both ends by calling Get all products API from homepage
- Back end data is retrieved successfully by front end but for now we are showing only dummy data 

## Redux Setup
Redux store in setup to store the data fetched from the backend at a single place. So, we can fetch all the data from the store instead of doing prop drilling.

## Test results 

### Home Page

## How to run
### Backend
 - download mongo db - make sure it is running by running command - `mongo`
- checkout main branch and cd into backend
- run - go run main.go start-server 
- It should show in your terminal that Db is connected.
- Verify server is running by running this - localhost:8081/ping - it should result in pong on your screen

### Frontend
 - download node - make sure it is running by running command - `node -v`
- checkout main branch and cd into frontend
- run npm install to install all the dependencies 
- run npm start to start the server
- Verify server is running by running this - localhost:3000 - it should display the home pages 

## Note
- On March 4, we squashed many commits of frontend due to which some of our commits lost their history.
