# Ecommerce Website
As e-commerce is booming, we will be creating a website where user will be able to select and purchase 'listed' products by adding them into his/her cart with end-to-end user authentication to be maintained by an admin. Therefore, mutiple profiles for user and admin will also be developed.
In this project we aim to develop an e-commerce store where general purpose items can be sold.
